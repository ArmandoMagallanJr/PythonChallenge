# PythonChallenge

This repository was created as a part of the 2023 Data Analytics bootcamp with UTSA and Trilogy. Inside you will find 2 python codes for the PyBank and PyPoll challenges. There is also 2 external txt files with the results of each activity printed within.

For this challenge assignment I referenced class materials as well as other repositories on github that can be found at the following links:
